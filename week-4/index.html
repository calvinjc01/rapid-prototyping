## Update 4 - Energy Collection Approaches

As the energy collection team, we started researching the different approaches to harvest solar energy to cook food. We determined from the start that we wouldn't use photovoltaics and would instead work on how to focus sunlight onto a surface to heat it. The first step was to find an estimate of the power we could expect using this method. 

The sun provides power to the Earth through radiation. The sun can be modeled as a black body, and the power it radiates at a given frequency follows the Planck formula closely. The atmosphere absorbs some of the light which hits the planet, especially at frequencies close to the resonant frequencies of water and CO2 molecules in the atmosphere. At the earth's surface, the average irradiance is 21.6 MJ/m^2 per day. (Research by Josh)

Using this figure, we adopted several approaches- from a Fresnel lens, to a parabolic mirror approximated by flat plates, to a linear Fresnel reflector. 
	
For a traditional Fresnel lens, the sunlight would pass through the lens with an efficiency of about 0.82 [2]. Multiplying this by the average daily insolation and an area of 0.627m^2 (the size of a commercially available Fresnel lens) [3] gives a daily energy collection of approximately 11.1MJ. There are two main benefits to this design. First, the collection is very simple and requires little adjustment, which means more time can be spent optimizing the collection surface and heat transfer to the other systems in the project. Second, the collection surface can be positioned such that there is relatively even energy deposition across the surface, reducing losses. (Research and sketch by Calvin)

A parabolic trough solar concentrator would focus energy onto a beam situated above the trough. The general structure of this model would be a stretched out parabola, and the beam passes through the focal point. A possible concern we discussed is if the intensity of light is too high and could possible damage the collector. There would also be significant thermal losses at high temperatures from radiation (T^4), but this design would ideally minimize these losses by having the collection spread out rather than concentrated at a point. (Research and sketch by Haeri)

We also discussed different mechanisms for the collection to track the sun, using either photosensitive electronics, open source solar tracking code, or a manual hinge that could be adjusted in the morning and afternoon.

Tracking helps about 50 W at peak hours, 100 W before and after. The tracking does not need to be too accurate, because of the cosine dependence -- 5 degrees of tilt will still capture 99.6% energy. (Research by David)
	

We looked at absorptive surface treatments specially designed for solar collection purposes to maximize the energy collected and minimize the energy lost from radiation as well as heat pipes to transfer energy from our collection surface to the storage and cooking systems. One initial thought is to use the number heat pipes to control how much energy is allocated to each system, which could allow for more collection during the day and cooking at a range of temperatures.
