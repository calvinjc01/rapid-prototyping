## Update 8 - Rotating Mechanisms

This week, we dove into the mechanics of how the solar tracking system would rotate. Our current design has light focused down through the center of the reflector and bounced off of a mirror onto the bottom of the salt battery. First, I performed trigonometric calculations to determine what kind of heights and distances would result in the light hitting the reflector when the sun is at an elevation angle of 20-30 degrees, the range of peak sunlight hours in Boston in late November.
