## Week 2 - Brainstorming the Final Project

This week we started to think of ideas for our final project. The overarching concept is to find a way to harness energy from the environment. The ideas ranged from didactic sculptures, to cooking tools, to electric bike motors. 
	
My group discussed several different ideas:
	
* Using solar and/or wind to charge an electric bike motor
* Generating electricity with a revolving door
* Heating sidewalks with waste heat from the sewer
* A display with two rubber surfaces- one with an enclosure of air above and one with an enclosure of CO2- to demonstrate the difference in heat from greenhouse gases
* Focusing sunlight to grill food in a pavilion, utilising a wind tower to cool the pavilion (working title: the grillin' pavillion)  

We also did some preliminary research on wind towers:
