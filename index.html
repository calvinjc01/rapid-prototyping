## Project Overview
	
The objective is to design an intervention that captures energy from the environment, and use it. This intentionally broad statement will guide the entire semester of work- from ideation, through the design process, to a working prototype. We will form specialized teams to focus on different aspects of the design- energy capture and distribution, mechanical design, materials, project management, etc. This approach mirrors that of an engineering firm, with each individual contributing their own area of specialization and interest to a broader collaborative project.
