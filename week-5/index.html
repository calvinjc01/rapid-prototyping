## Update 5 - Integration Ideas and Solar Tracking

This week, I took a brief look into an idea for an integrated system and solar tracking. First, the idea for an integrated system. My goal here was to design a solar collection method that didn't require solar tracking. The result was a roof with a flat top and four angled sides made out of fresnel lenses. That way, regardless of the position of the sun or the structure, sunlight would be focused. The first iteration of this involved a long tube of reflective material that would direct the light down and onto a collection surface. The benefit of the tube would be a collection surface much closer to the other systems, minimizing thermodynamic losses. However, the angles become complicated as the sun's elevation changes with the seasons.

To address this issue I thought to replace the focusing tube with a collection hemisphere. This would collect the focused light regardless of the season more effectively but also introduces a significant challenge in its distance from the storage and cooking systems.

Alternatively, we could embrace solar tracking and try to maximize the energy collected with one lens. I thought of two broad ideas for solar tracking. Parallel tracking, so called because the long side of the lens is parallel to the path of the sun, and perpendicular tracking, in which the long side of the lens is perpendicular to the path of the sun. Either of these methods could be paired with photosensitive electronics or a database of the sun's position in a certain location to control the motion of the lens. Parallel tracking is simpler in the fact that the axes of rotation are separate. However, the process of rotating the entire system to track the azimuthal angle every day may consume a lot of energy. Perpendicular tracking is more mechanically complicated as the joints between the lens and support must have multiple degrees of freedom. However, it might consume less energy by reducing the overall motion of the system per day.
