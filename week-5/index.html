## Update 5 - Integration Ideas and Solar Tracking

This week, I took a brief look into an idea for an integrated system and solar tracking. First, the idea for an integrated system. My goal here was to design a solar collection method that didn't require solar tracking. The result was a roof with a flat top and four angled sides made out of fresnel lenses. That way, regardless of the position of the sun or the structure, sunlight would be focused. The first iteration of this involved a long tube of reflective material that would direct the light down and onto a collection surface. The benefit of the tube would be a collection surface much closer to the other systems, minimizing thermodynamic losses. However, the angles become complicated as the sun's elev

At the end of the week, we settled on the broader product idea of using renewable energy to cook food, heat water, or other similar applications. We also developed research questions:

* Q: Have there been other attempts at renewable, on-demand cooking? A: A company called Sun Buckets has developed a similar device that uses phase changing salt to store heat
* Q: What temperature ranges are useful? A: Residential uses cap out around 500F, also depends on the cooking technique
* Q: What are different materials to store heat? A: Water, solids, salt, wax
