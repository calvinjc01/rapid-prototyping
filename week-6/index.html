## Update 6 - Motion, Solar Tracking Calculator, and Reflector

The solar tracking team began to look at various types of methods that could be used to physically move our collection element (stepper motor, rack and pinion, pulleys, etc.) One initial idea I had was to use 3 actuators to adjust the elevation and azimuthal angle of the parabolic mirror/lens. However, this method would require very long actuators to achieve the desired angles. An alternate idea was to use one actuator to control the elevation angle and place the entire set up on a rotating platform to track the azimuthal angle.

To control this movement, I began working on a solar tracking calculator. Fortunately, NOAA already has its own [calculator](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/) and an excel spreadsheet to perform all the calculations for the elevation and azimuathal angles of the sun throughout the day for a given date and location. Having a solar calculator controlling the motion of the motors would be beneficial in improving the efficiency of collection. It would also be entirely self contained, not relying on peripherals which could malfunction or be misled by reflections/clouds. This method would require some kind of user input for the location, unless a separate GPS chip is added to the system, and a separate clock to keep track of time. The GPS isn't wildly expensive and the clock is very cheap. The main obstacle will be reading data from these separate pieces into the software being used to perform the calculations.  
	
Finally, I thought of a way to focus light down from a parabolic mirror. One of the main difficulties in using a mirror to collect solar energy is the fact that the focal point is above the mirror and our heavy storage container filled with molten salt must be on the ground. My idea is to have a reflective surface above the mirror that intercepts the light on its path to the focal point and changes its direction back toward the mirror. However, if the mirror has a hole beneath the reflector, this light will reach a focal point at some point below the mirror. The exact details, specifically the angles and how much efficiency would be lost, aren't fully fleshed out, but I think its a promising starting point for future iteration.
