## Update 6 - Motion, Solar Tracking Calculator, and Reflector

The solar tracking team began to look at various types of methods that could be used to physically move our collection element (stepper motor, rack and pinion, pulleys, etc.) One initial idea I had was to use 3 actuators to adjust the elevation and azimuthal angle of the parabolic mirror/lens. However, this method would require very long actuators to achieve the desired angles. An alternate idea was to use one actuator to control the elevation angle and place the entire set up on a rotating platform to track the azimuthal angle.

To address this issue I thought to replace the focusing tube with a collection hemisphere. This would collect the focused light regardless of the season more effectively but also introduces a significant challenge in its distance from the storage and cooking systems.

Alternatively, we could embrace solar tracking and try to maximize the energy collected with one lens. I thought of two broad ideas for solar tracking. Parallel tracking, so called because the long side of the lens is parallel to the path of the sun, and perpendicular tracking, in which the long side of the lens is perpendicular to the path of the sun. Either of these methods could be paired with photosensitive electronics or a database of the sun's position in a certain location to control the motion of the lens. Parallel tracking is simpler in the fact that the axes of rotation are separate. However, the process of rotating the entire system to track the azimuthal angle every day may consume a lot of energy. Perpendicular tracking is more mechanically complicated as the joints between the lens and support must have multiple degrees of freedom. However, it might consume less energy by reducing the overall motion of the system per day.
