## Week 1 - Design Fun

For the first week, we worked on designing a phone case out of a sponge. We were given intentionally poor materials to build confidence in our designing capabilities.
We were set up to fail so we could feel free to experiment without fear of failure because failure was the expected outcome. If we happened to succeed despite the 
disadvantage, we would feel even more capable having overcome significant obstacles to design a succesful product. Since this was the first project, I hadn't yet realized the importance of documenting the design process. I did get some pictures of our final sponge phone case though, so here it is!

Our primary idea was to lean into the absurdity of using sponge as a phone case material and set our target audience as kids. To fit this, we added handles to the side of the case. Since a child's hands might not fit around a phone, the handles are useful to help them carry it around. We added a slot on the side through which to slide the phone in order to insert it into the case. From there we spent many hours trying, unsuccessfully, to devise a method to stand the phone up. 
	
After this first adventure into design, I made this website!
