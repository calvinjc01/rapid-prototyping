## Week 2 - Focusing In
	
We broke out into three groups: capture, storage, and use. I joined energy capture due to the wide variety of potential energy sources. I was especially interested in harnessing multiple types of energy simultaneously (i.e. solar, wind, and mechanical). In our group we discussed the density of different energy sources- with solar being the highest and rain the lowest (although we didn't do calculations for piezoelectricity). One concept that came up was developing a system to place on top of steps that would harness the energy of people walking up and down. I initially thought of piezoelectricity, but other members of the group brought up a rack and pinion mechanism to turn a turbine, which would improve the efficiency of the system. 

Energy Density by Type:
	* Solar- 1.28kW
	* Rain- 100mW
	* Wind- 27.4W
	* Human- 28.2 W

Ultimately, we thought of three ways to generate electricity: photovoltaics, turning a turbine, or piezoelectricity. Piezoelectrics are relatively inefficient and photovoltaics are well established and "too easy" for our design. This leaves turning a turbine to generate electricity. This category is fairly broad though as we can turn the turbine mechanically (such as using the rack and pinion outlined above) or
