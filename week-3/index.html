## Update 3 - Focusing In
	
We broke out into three groups: capture, storage, and use. I joined energy capture due to the wide variety of potential energy sources. I was especially interested in harnessing multiple types of energy simultaneously (i.e. solar, wind, and mechanical). In our group we discussed the density of different energy sources- with solar being the highest and rain the lowest (although we didn't do calculations for piezoelectricity). One concept that came up was developing a system to place on top of steps that would harness the energy of people walking up and down. I initially thought of piezoelectricity, but other members of the group brought up a rack and pinion mechanism to turn a turbine, which would improve the efficiency of the system. 

Energy Density by Type:
* Solar- 1.28kW
* Rain- 100mW
* Wind- 27.4W
* Human- 28.2 W

Ultimately, we thought of three ways to generate electricity: photovoltaics, turning a turbine, or piezoelectricity. Piezoelectrics are relatively inefficient and photovoltaics are well established and "too easy" for our design. This leaves turning a turbine to generate electricity. This category is fairly broad though as we can turn the turbine mechanically (such as using the rack and pinion outlined above) or by using steam, like a power plant. Since we need to generate a rotational force regardless, I was thinking about using a revolving door to generate electricity, although the lack of revolving doors around campus does pose a challenge to this concept. However, electricity isn't the only useful form of energy. Heat can be used to cook food, warm spaces, or heat water. Compost or geothermal can be used to warm spaces or water while solar can be concentrated to boil water or cook food. From here, our discussion slowed as much of the energy capture strategy is dependent on the use (i.e. heat vs. electricity, large vs. small scale).

At the end of the week, we settled on the broader product idea of using renewable energy to cook food, heat water, or other similar applications. We also developed research questions:
* Q: Have there been other attempts at renewable, on-demand cooking? A: A company called Sun Buckets has developed a similar 
* Q: What temperature ranges are useful? A: Residential uses cap out around 500F, also depends on the cooking technique
* Q: What are different materials to store heat? A: Water, solids, salt, wax
