## Week 2 - Brainstorming the Final Project

This week we started to think of ideas for our final project. The overarching concept is to find a way to harness energy from the environment. The ideas ranged from didactic sculptures, to cooking tools, to electric bike motors. 
	
My group discussed several different ideas:
	
* Using solar and/or wind to charge an electric bike motor
* Generating electricity with a revolving door
* Heating sidewalks with waste heat from the sewer
* A display with two rubber surfaces- one with an enclosure of air above and one with an enclosure of CO2- to demonstrate the difference in heat from greenhouse gases
* Focusing sunlight to grill food in a pavilion, utilising a wind tower to cool the pavilion (working title: the grillin' pavillion)  

We also did some preliminary research on wind towers:

And elaborated more on the solar cooking idea. One point of concern was being able to cook into the night. Our first thought was to store the heat. Molten salts have been used for heat storage in the energy sector but the process of obtaining and designing a system to contain these salts is tricky. Pressurized water could be heated during the day and then run through a loop to heat the grill at night but this poses a major safety issue and again complicates the design. We started to move away from a thermofluid based heat storage system. The processes and systems involved would be quite complicated, perhaps unnecessarily so. What if we just heated up a large block of solid and transferred the heat via conduction to the grill? This idea showed a bit more promise, but posed its own challenge in the small amount of surface area available to connect the grill to the block and the presence of a large, hot object in the pavilion. This got us thinking about using electricity to heat the grill at night. We could charge a battery during the day using either photovoltaic cells or a system that focused solar rays to vaporize water to turn a turbine and then use that battery to power the grill through ohmic heating at night. With a variety of ideas for energy storage, we turned our sights to the material for the grill. 

Adopting the electric storage approach, we would need a material with low specific heat capacity and high electrical resistance. This proved difficult as thermal and electrical conductivity often go hand in hand. Luckily, electrical resistance in metals increases with temperature. Looking at aluminum as a material for the grill, we calculated that it would take roughly 1.5 minutes to heat an aluminum plate to the temperatures desired for cooking using all of the solar energy from the area of the pavillion's roof. However, aluminum has a relatively high specific heat capacity so this time could be decreased by selecting a material with a lower specific heat capacity, such as iron, tin, or titanium.
