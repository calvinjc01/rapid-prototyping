## Update 9 - Finalizing CAD Models

Most of this week was spent finishing up the 3D models in Fusion 360 to make sure all the components fit together. The design started with a ring (highlighted in the image below) with teeth on the inside to act as the counterpart to the gear on the stepper motor. This ring will be laser cut out of Delrin and secured to the top of a larger platform made out of plywood. The plywood ring will serve as the structure and staging area for the reflector and molten salt battery. These rings will rotate together to track the azimuthal angle of the sun while the motor is held stationary, embedded in a secure pillar in the middle.

Below we see the model with both the reflector and salt box positioned on the plywood ring. In this iteration, the light is focused through the center of the reflector and hits the side/top of the salt box.

The box will be supported by flat wooden planks secured across 2x2 wood pieces or 80/20 in the back and brackets fastened to 80/20 in the front.
